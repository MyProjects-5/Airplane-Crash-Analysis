# Airplane-Crash-Analysis-Tableau 

# Overview:
This project, part of my Mentorness internship, aims to analyze airplane crashes using district-wise and year-wise data. The dataset provides insights into various aspects of airplane accidents, including locations, fatalities, aircraft types, and causes across different years and regions. Leveraging Tableau, the goal is to develop interactive visualizations that uncover trends, identify risk factors, and inform safety measures for the aviation industry.

# Objective:
The objective of an airplane crash analysis presentation is to delve into the causes of crashes, improve safety measures, inform stakeholders about investigation findings, highlight prevention strategies, and raise awareness about the importance of continuous improvement in aviationÂ safety.
Certainly! The presentation aims to dissect the intricate factors behind airplane crashes, offering insights to enhance safety protocols, educate stakeholders, and advocate for proactive measures to prevent futureÂ incidents.


# ðŸ“ŒKey Features:
1. **Data Exploration:** Utilize Tableau visuals to explore and understand the structure of airplane crash data, including details such as location, aircraft type, and fatalities.
2. **Major-Incidents Analysis:** Analyze trends in major airplane incidents, focusing on factors such as fatalities, aircraft types, and causes to identify patterns and risk factors.
3. **Region Analysis:** Investigate region-wise patterns of airplane crashes to understand geographical variations and potential areas of heightened risk.
4. **Seasonal Analysis:** Explore seasonal patterns in airplane crashes, considering factors such as weather conditions and peak travel periods.
5. **Operator Analysis:** Analyze the performance of different airline operators in terms of incident rates, fatalities, and safety records to identify areas for improvement.

# ðŸ“Œ conclusion
In conclusion, our Tableau analysis of airplane crashes has provided valuable insights into historical trends, geographical distributions, operator performances, aircraft types, and route safety considerations. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing safety measures, enhancing regulatory frameworks, and fostering collaboration to ensure safer airÂ travelÂ forÂ all.
